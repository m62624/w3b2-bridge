/*
    This file defines the core data structures used for communication within the W3B2 protocol.
    These structs are primarily for off-chain use by the client (e.g., a TypeScript frontend)
    and the server (`w3b2-connector`).

    The on-chain program (`dispatch_command` instruction) does not interpret these structs directly.
    Instead, it treats them as an opaque byte array (`Vec<u8>`) in the `payload`. The client
    serializes a struct (like `CommandConfig`) into this byte array, and the off-chain server
    deserializes it upon receiving the `CommandEvent`.

    This approach keeps the on-chain logic minimal and gas-efficient, acting as a secure message
    broker, while allowing for complex and flexible off-chain communication protocols.
